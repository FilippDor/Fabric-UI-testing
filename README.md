# Fabric_PowerBI_CI_CD_demo

> Practical demo and reference implementation for applying Git-based version control and CI/CD patterns to Microsoft Fabric artifacts (Lakehouse, Notebooks, Pipelines, and Power BI semantic models).

---

## Project overview

This repository demonstrates a pragmatic DevOps workflow for Microsoft Fabric projects, showing how to:

- Connect a Fabric workspace to a Git repository (GitHub or Azure DevOps).
- Keep Lakehouse artifacts, Notebooks, and Pipelines under version control.
- Use feature branches, pull requests, and merge strategies to collaborate safely.
- Apply a simple CI/CD pattern to validate and deploy changes into staging/production Fabric workspaces.

This is intentionally a small, practical demo aimed at being reproducible with sample data and minimal Azure overhead. Use the repo as a template you can copy into your organization's GitOps workflows.
